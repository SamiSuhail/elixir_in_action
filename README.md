# elixir_in_action
A repo of me learning Elixir through Saša Juric's "Elixir in Action, Third Edition"

I had already played around on Exercism's platform so most of the first 4 chapters wasn't new to me.

Still, I am starting the exercises at chapter 4, because it's mentioning that we will be building on it for the rest of the book. 

I will be doing all exercises in the second and third parts of the book (chapters 5 onwards), as those will mostly be new concepts for me, plus Saša himself mentions in interviews that's the interesting part of the book :)

For the first few chapters, I am using livebooks which you will find in the livebook/ directory. For everything after chapter 7 I am using a mix project as recommended in the book.
