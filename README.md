# elixir_in_action_livebook
A livebook of me learning Elixir through Sa≈°a Juric's "Elixir in Action, Third Edition"

I had already played around on Exercism's platform so most of the first 4 chapters wasn't new to me.

Still, I am starting the Livebook exercises at chapter 4, because it's mentioning that we will be building on it for the rest of the book. 

I will be doing all exercises in the second and third parts of the book (chapters 5 onwards), as those will mostly be new concepts for me, plus Sasa himself mentions in interviews that's the interesting part of the book :)
